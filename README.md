0x16. C - Simple Shell
This project has been done by [Parsitau Michael](https://github.com/Parsitau-michael) in collaboration with [Leonard Jembe](https://github.com/Mbaruku2003) as collaborators.
The project entails writing a simple UNIX command interpreter; In other word we are building a custom shell program that can take commands from the user and executes them.
